## Introduction

The objective of this course is to enable students to utilize advanced
computational and data capabilities for research and industrial
practice through 1) proper project, code, and data management
techniques; 2) wide range of research workflows to solve complex
problems; 3) integration of optimization or other domain specific
software tools; and 4) parallel computing on High Performance
Computing clusters.

This course will give students the skills, tools, and hands-on
experience required to effectively utilize advanced computational and
data capabilities for their research.  Topics will include command
line usage, batch submission on HPC systems, source code revision
management systems, relational and non-relational databases, message
and data structures, web application programmer interfaces,
computational engineering software, software development, test driven
development (TDD), scientific and engineering workflows, data
management, experimental design, and the life-cycle of research
projects.  Tools include Git, Python, R, Julia, SQLite with domain
specific tools such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and others.


### Outline 
 * Welcome and personal introduction
 * Motivation for the class (scientific and engineering workflows)
 * Class structure and outline of topics
 * Careers in Research Computing
 * Expectations and syllabus overview
 * Accessing and using course resources (Hand On)
 * Discussion


## Motivation

This course is about
 * reproducible science at scale, and 
 * shareable and sustainable development.

We will utilize the "One, Two, Three, Go!" method.

Remembering that
 * "research is hard";
 * to "do it right" and to "show your work";
 * and that "Training is a process, not happening" - Earl Farrell.

At the end of this course you should be able to
 1. reproduce and share your research,
 2. collaborate with others on your research,
 3. scale your research on high performance computing systems, 
 4. develop in a secure and sustainable way 
 5. producing correct results.
