## Tools

This class is approached from two directions.  Concepts and Tools.  It
takes a tool-first approach not because they are more important, they
are only a means to an end, but because the technical constraints,
prerequisites, and the shear time it takes to absorb and use the tools
had to be carefully constructed.  The tools are used to apply concepts
and techniques.  We will always try to motivate and explain the "why"
of the tools but it takes active participation and thinking. The tools
are replaceable, the concepts and techniques endure.
