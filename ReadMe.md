## Course Description
Enable students to utilize advanced computational and data
capabilities for research and industrial practice through 1) proper
project, code, and data management techniques; 2) wide range of
research workflows to solve complex problems; 3) integration of
optimization or other domain specific software tools; and 4) parallel
computing on High Performance Computing clusters.

## Course Objectives
The objective of this course is to give students the skills, tools,
and hands-on experience required to effectively utilize advanced
computational and data capabilities for their research.  Topics will
include command line usage, source code revision management systems,
relational and non-relational databases, message and data structures,
web application programmer interfaces, computational engineering
software, scientific and engineering workflows, data management, and
the life-cycle of research projects.  Tools include Git, Python, and R
with domain specific tools.
